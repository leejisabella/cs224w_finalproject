Code is written in Jupyter Notebooks for easy integration with Google Colab. This repo will eventually contain 5 models for a restaurant recommender system built off of Google Restaurant data:
1) Base Model: LightGCN (basic_model.ipynb)
2) Extended Model 1: LightGCL (basic_model.ipynb)
3) Extended Model 2: LightGCL + Distance Awareness (basic_model.ipynb)
4) PinSage (basic_model.ipynb)
5) LightGCN + HGT Layer (basic_model.ipynb)

Please see the following link for the data sources: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CObpfsYBeAisbhS6fwXGEb5_wNPNnyUw/view?usp=sharing. This link contains both the full dataset as well as the subset. Note that we will use the subset for testing due to computational constraints. Processed datasets can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mI9jEhjXwF2EiZcc70CAbmgj3fc06M0Y?usp=sharing.

JSON processing code and CSV creation can be found in basic_model_with_dta_prep.ipynb.
