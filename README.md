Code is written in Jupyter Notebooks for easy integration with Google Colab. This repo will eventually contain 5 models for a restaurant recommender system built off of Google Restaurant data:
1) Base Model: LightGCN
2) Extended Model 1: LightGCL
3) Extended Model 2: LightGCL + Distance Awareness
4) PinSage
5) LightGCN + HGT Layer
